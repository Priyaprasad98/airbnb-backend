# 🏡 Airbnb Backend 

Welcome to my Airbnb-inspired backend project!  
Built with **Node.js**, **Express.js**, and soon... the mighty **MongoDB** (I promise it's coming). This project is part of my attempt to make sense of backend development and actually understand where all those data go.

I’m using this project to practice:
- Express.js routing and middleware
- REST API principles
- File-based storage as a mock database (currently using JSON files)
- Working with EJS for simple server-side rendering
- Moving toward real database handling using MongoDB

## 📚 Technologies I'm Learning

- **Node.js** (Backend programming with JavaScript)
- **Express.js** (Server and routing framework)
- **MongoDB** (Database – to be integrated soon)
- **EJS Templates** (Basic rendering)
- **File Handling in Node.js**
- **Modular Code Structure** (controllers, routes, models)

## 🚀 Features Built So Far

- 🏠 Display home listings (using static data)
- ❤️ Add homes to favorites (IDs stored in JSON file)
- ❌ Remove homes from favorites
- 📄 View current favorites
- 🚦 Basic routing using Express.js
